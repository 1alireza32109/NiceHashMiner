# <a name="benefits"></a> What are the benefits?

- Plugin implementation allows easier tweaking for advanced users like changing ExtraLaunchParameters, SystemEnvironmentVariables and settings that are miner specific (some miners have special settings).
- Adding of the new miners or just updating old ones was never so easy, as now with MinerPlugin and MinerPluginToolkitV1.
- Cross referencing detected devices with miner device id's (this should fix mixing up GPUs especially on mixed rigs).
